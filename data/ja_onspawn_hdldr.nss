// OnSpawnIn
/*
  Lots of toggleable options, and plenty to read. Most things are fully working, while
  some have not been tested too much. I think all work fine though.

  Note: I have removed:
    - Teleporting (this seemed bugged anyway, or useless)
    - Spawn in animation. This is bugged, and looks wierd. Also does not work with the weapon setting.
    - Day/night posting. This is uneeded, with a changed walk waypoints that does it automatically.
